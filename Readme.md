# Forest Condition Assessment
An accompanying code and data repository for the paper *Assessing a Landsat-based harmonic modeling approach for forest condition monitoring using defoliator abundance and defoliation measurements*. 

Here, we compare the relative predictive ability of various parameterizations of remote-sensed forest condition assessments on abundance and damage from a *Lymantria dispar* outbreak in southern New England. 

#### Instructions:
* Data files should be stored inside the [data](data/) directory.
* Analyses should be stored in the [analyses](analyses/) directory.
* Use the [analysis template](analyses/Analysis-Template.Rmd) in analyses/ as a starting point.

#### List of Analyses:
* [Defoliation Models](analyses/Defoliation-Models.md) - Comparison of defoliation models for forest condition assessment
* [Using AIC weights to pick a winner](analyses/AIC_weights.md) - Can AIC model weights be used to pick a consensus best model parameterization?
